# Problem 1 Statement

Implement a function named factorial that has one parameter: an integer, `n`. It must return the value of `n!` (i.e., `n` factorial).

## Input Format

Locked stub code in the editor reads a single integer, `n` , from stdin and passes it to a function named factorial.

## Constraints

`1 <= n <= 10`

## Output Format

The function must return the value of `n!`.

### Sample Input 0

`4`
### Sample Output 0

`24`

# Problem 2 Statement

1. Declare a constant variable, `PI`, and assign it the value Math.PI. You will not pass this challenge unless the variable is declared as a constant and named PI (uppercase).
2. Read a number, `r`, denoting the radius of a circle from stdin.
3. Use `PI` and `r` to calculate the `area` and `perimeter` of a circle having radius `r`.
4. Print `area` as the first line of output and print `perimeter` as the second line of output.

## Input Format

A single integer, `r`, denoting the radius of a circle.

## Constraints

1. `0 < r <= 100`
`r` is a floating-point number scaled to at most `3` decimal places.

## Output Format

* Print the following two lines:

1. On the first line, print the `area` of the circle having radius `r`.
2. n the second line, print the `perimeter` of the circle having radius `r`.

## Sample Input 0

`2.6`
## Sample Output 0
