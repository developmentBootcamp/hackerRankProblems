# Task

Variables named `firstInteger`, `firstDecimal` and `firstString` are declared for you in the editor below. You must use the `+` operator to perform the following sequence of operations:

1. Convert `secondInteger` to an integer (Number type), then sum it with `firstInteger` and print the result on a new line using console.log.
2. Convert `secondDecimal` to a floating-point number (Number type), then sum it with `firstDecimal` and print the result on a new line using console.log.
3. Print the concatenation of `firstString` and `secondString` on a new line using console.log. Note that  must be printed first.

## Output Format

Print the following three lines of output:

1. On the first line, print the sum of  `firstInteger` and the integer representation of `secondInteger`.
2. On the second line, print the sum of  `firstDecimal` and the floating-point representation of `secondDecimal`.
3. On the third line, print `firstString` concatenated with `secondString`. You must print `firstString` before `secondString`.

### Sample Input 0

* 12
* 4.32
* is the best place to learn and practice coding!

### Sample Output 0

* 16
* 8.32
* HackerRank is the best place to learn and practice coding!

### Explanation 0

1. When we sum the integers **4** and **12**, we get the integer **16**.
2. When we sum the floating-point numbers **4.0** and **4.32**, we get **8.32**. 
3. When we Concatenate **HackerRank** with **is the best place to learn and practice coding!**, we get **HackerRank is the best place to learn and practice coding!**.

**You will not pass this challenge if you attempt to assign the Sample Case values to your variables instead of following the instructions above.**
