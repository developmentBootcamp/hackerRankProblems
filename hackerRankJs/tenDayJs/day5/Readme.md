# Problem 1 Statement
We provide the implementation for a Rectangle class in the editor. Perform the following tasks:

Add an area method to Rectangle's prototype.
Create a Square class that satisfies the following:
* It is a subclass of Rectangle.
* It contains a constructor and no other methods.
* It can use the Rectangle class' area method to print the area of a Square object.

Locked code in the editor tests the class and method implementations and prints the area values to STDOUT.
